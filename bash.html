	 	BASH. <br>

	 	I can’t keep seeing you. Your every <span class="word"> touch </span> creates new problems, I don’t know if I should <span class="word">cd</span> through all the directories you have put me through.
	<br>
	<br>
	You tried to show me how I could change your files through <span class="word"> nano </span> but it just wasn’t enough… I don’t know why I keep trying to use <span class="word"> pwd </span> to find out where we are… You always seem to overcomplicate everything from uploading to the server through terminal to maneuvering to other files.
	<br>
	<br>
	You have so many secret commands, even when I try to use <span class="word"> autocomplete </span> you frustrate me with all the wrong options.
	<br>
	<br>
	Every little typo or mistake I make always leads to a series of error messages that you love to spit out at me. Even though we look cool together at that cool hipster coffee shop you’re just too high maintenance for me.
	<br>
	<br>
	See you around,
	<br>
	Jen
